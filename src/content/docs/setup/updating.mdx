<Steps>

1. Make a backup of your current bot directory in case of issues so you have the option to revert back.

2. Make sure not to delete your `data` directory otherwise you might run into issues with tickets that you did not delete yet.

3. Download the new release/files and replace the current files with the ones you downloaded.

4. If you already followed the installation process, you can use the latest `config.yml.example` you downloaded to manually add any new config options to your config.yml.

   A lightweight option to easily update your config to the latest version is the compare plugin of the notepad++ program.

5. If any dependencies got updated, you will have to delete your `node_modules` directory and install the dependencies again after you've already uploaded the new files:

   <Code code="npm install" lang="shellscript" />

6. Start the updated bot:
   <Code code="npm start" lang="shellscript" />
</Steps>
