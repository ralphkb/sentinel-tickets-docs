3. Give your bot a name and proceed by clicking the `Create` button.

4. You can edit your application's name, avatar and description in the `General Information` tab.

5. Open the `Bot` tab, click on the `Add Bot` button and confirm by clicking `Yes, do it!`

6. You can edit your bot's username, icon and banner in the `Bot` tab.

7. Scroll down in the `Bot` tab and enable all 3 intents then click on `Save Changes`

8. You can get the `Client ID` from the `General Information` tab and the bot `Token` from the `Bot` tab to paste them later in your `.env` file.

   <Aside type="danger" title="Warning">

   Never share your bot token with anyone, make sure you only copy paste it into the .env file and then delete it from your clipboard.

9. To invite the bot to your discord server, head over to the `OAuth2` tab, scroll down and click on both the `bot` and `applications.commands` scope.  
Click on the `Administrator` permission and your bot invite link will be generated which can be copied via the `Copy` button.

   <Aside type="tip">

   Depending on how you configure the bot, it may not require the `Administrator` permission. You may test to figure out if your setup does not require it.  
   If you get a console error that says "Missing Permissions" then your bot does need the `Administrator` permission.
