## Commands Permissions
You can configure the permission required for each slash command or context menu command to be executed by modifying the `config.yml` section for command permissions.  
{ }
The default config has `KickMembers` as a required permission for most commands but this can be easily changed. The idea behind this default value is that your staff roles will likely have the permission to kick members and the bot commands will not be available to all members out of the box, to avoid issues.

<Code code={`alert:\n  enabled: true\n  permission: \"KickMembers\"`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />

   <Aside>You may need to run the `/reload` command after restarting the bot to apply new permission changes.</Aside>

## Category Permissions
The bot currently supports configuring the following permissions: ticket creator, support roles, added roles and added users for each ticket category.  
The way it works is by having configuration options to allow/deny permissions for both open and closed tickets. This way you can customize the permissions that best fit your use-case.  

<Code code={`
permissions:
  ticketCreator:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: ["SendMessages"]
  supportRoles:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: ["SendMessages"]
  addedRoles:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: ["SendMessages"]
  addedUsers:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: ["SendMessages"]
`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />

The default values will give the ticket creator, support roles, added roles and added users the 5 permissions in the allow array on newly created tickets and re-opened tickets. It will also deny the Send Messages permission for all of them in the case of a closed ticket.  
Note that added roles and added users are the roles/users added via the `/add` command.

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning">
  Depending on the permissions you put in the ticket categories, you may need to give your bot **Administrator** permissions to function properly.  
  If you get a console error that says "Missing Permissions" then your bot is lacking permissions.
</Aside>

### Examples

#### Example 1
Adding `ViewChannels` to the deny permissions of the ticketCreator in the close permissions, then they cannot see the channel anymore when a ticket gets closed and by having `ViewChannels` in the allow permissions of the ticketCreator, it will be added again on re-open.  
<Code code={`
permissions:
  ticketCreator:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: ["SendMessages", "ViewChannel"]
  supportRoles:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: ["SendMessages"]
`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />  

#### Example 2
Leaving the close deny permissions empty for the support roles leads to them keeping their permissions upon the closure of a ticket. This means they would be able to chat in closed tickets.  
<Code code={`
permissions:
  ticketCreator:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: ["SendMessages"]
  supportRoles:
    open:
      allow: ["ViewChannel", "SendMessages", "EmbedLinks", "AttachFiles", "ReadMessageHistory"]
      deny: []
    close:
      allow: []
      deny: []
`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />
