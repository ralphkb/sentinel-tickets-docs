### How to properly add IDs in the config file?
Some default options that use IDs have an empty array `[]`, which indicates support for more than one ID.  
To properly add IDs to it, you should use this format: `configOption: ["ID", "ID", "ID"]`  
**Examples:**  
1. `support_role_ids: ["000000000000000000"]`
2. `support_role_ids: ["000000000000000000", "111111111111111111"]`

### How to use custom emojis in the config file?
To use custom emojis for buttons or select menus, you need to use the following format:
<Code code={`emoji: "<:emojiName:ID>"`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />  
Example:  
<Code code={`emoji: "<:test:0000000000000000000>"`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />
