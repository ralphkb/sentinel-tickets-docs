### How to get the ID of a role/channel/category/guild?
Open the `User Settings` in your discord client then click on `Advanced` and enable `Developer Mode`.

Getting the IDs:
- For a role: open the server settings, click the `Roles` tab, right click on the role and click the `Copy Role ID` button.
- For a channel: right click the channel and click the `Copy Channel ID` button.
- For a category: right click the category and click the `Copy Channel ID` button.
- For a guild: right click the server and click the `Copy Server ID` button.

<Aside type="tip">
  Regarding the `client ID` which is required in the `.env` file, you can find information to locate it by checking step 8 on this [*page*](/setup/createabot).

### How to properly add IDs in the config file?
Some default options that use IDs have an empty array `[]`, which indicates support for more than one ID.  
To properly add IDs to it, you should use this format: `configOption: ["ID", "ID", "ID"]`  
**Examples:**  
1. `support_role_ids: ["000000000000000000"]`
2. `support_role_ids: ["000000000000000000", "111111111111111111"]`

<Aside>
  If your permissions or anything related to arrays of IDs is not working correctly, you most likely forgot to add the quotes `""` while adding the IDs.  
  You would have to change something like this:   
  `support_role_ids: [000000000000000000, 111111111111111111]`   
  to this: `support_role_ids: ["000000000000000000", "111111111111111111"]` to fix the issue.

### How to use custom emojis in the config file?
To use custom emojis for buttons or select menus, you need to use the following format:
<Code code={`emoji: "<:emojiName:ID>"`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />  
Example:  
<Code code={`emoji: "<:test:0000000000000000000>"`} lang="yaml" title="config.yml" />  

<Aside type="tip">
  To get the emoji ID, you can send the emoji in chat preceded by a `\`.  
  For example, if your emoji name was test, you would write `\:test:`

### How to update some ticket statistics in case of inconsistency or issues?
You can do so by using the `/stats set` command and selecting the statistic you want to update followed by inserting the new value of the statistic.  
An example usage of this feature would be if you moved from a different discord tickets bot and want to keep the previous `Total Tickets` count.

<Aside>
  For now, only the following stats can be modified using the command: `Total Tickets, Total Open Tickets, Total Claims & Total Messages`.  
  Avoid using this command unless necessary to keep stats consistent.

### Why is the bot breaking when using the config.yml.french.example?
The French config and README are contributions from French users of the community. They can often remain very outdated but you may use them as a reference in case you are translating the config to French.
