### An invalid token was provided
Make sure that you renamed your `.env.example` to `.env` then fill it with the correct bot token, client ID and guild ID.

### Could not locate the bindings file
This error is related to your `node_modules` directory. To fix this issue, check your NodeJS version and avoid using NodeJS 19 since it can cause such issues sometimes.  
It's recommended to use the latest version of either Node.js 22 or higher, though Node.js 18, 20 & 21 should work too. After ensuring that, delete your `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` again to reinstall the dependencies, which should fix your issue.

### Unknown Application
Double check your `.env` file and ensure the client ID and guild ID are correct. This error mostly happens when your client ID is incorrect, please refer to <a href="/setup/createabot">this page</a> to understand how to get the client ID.

### YAMLParseError
If you run into an error like that then the issue comes from the configuration. It's recommended you read the error message to figure out where it is and you could assist yourself in finding the error by using a YAML linter such as <a href="https://www.yamllint.com/" target="_blank">yamllint</a> or <a href="https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator" target="_blank">jsonformatter</a>.

### Missing Permissions
You may get this error if the bot is missing permissions to perform specific required actions. In that case, to fix the issue you will need to give the bot permissions either via category, channel or role permissions. You may also need to give the bot the `Administrator` permission to use all the features without issues.
