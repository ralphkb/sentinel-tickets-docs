### An invalid token was provided
Make sure that you renamed your `.env.example` to `.env` then fill it with the correct bot token, client ID and guild ID.

### Could not locate the bindings file
This error is related to your `node_modules` directory. To fix this issue, check your NodeJS version and avoid using NodeJS 19 since it can cause such issues sometimes.  
It's recommended to use the latest version of either NodeJS 18 or 20+, they should be more stable and work properly. After ensuring that, delete your `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` again to reinstall the dependencies, which should fix your issue.
